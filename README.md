## Tobeto Education Platform - Backend

**Technologies**: .NET Core, MSSQL, Entity Framework Core, Redis, JWT, RESTful APIs, Serilog, FluentValidation, AutoMapper, LINQ

- **Developed a Modular N-Tier Architecture**:  
  Designed and implemented a flexible and maintainable **N-Tier architecture** for Tobeto, an education platform. This architecture enabled seamless access to courses, assignments, exams, and live classes for users by separating concerns into different layers, making the project more scalable and easier to maintain in the long run.

- **Implemented Secure JWT Authentication and Authorization**:  
  Integrated **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for authentication and authorization to ensure secure user interactions. This mechanism allowed users to log in securely and access different parts of the system based on their permissions. As a result, user data was protected, and the overall security of the system was enhanced.

- **Optimized Performance with Redis Caching**:  
  Used **Redis caching** to improve performance by minimizing repetitive database queries and speeding up data retrieval processes. Redis helped the system respond more quickly, improving the user experience through faster interactions and reduced load times.

- **Handled Database Operations with Entity Framework Core**:  
  Utilized **Entity Framework Core** to optimize database operations by abstracting direct database interactions, making data management more secure and efficient. Queries were optimized for performance, resulting in a robust and scalable data access layer that streamlined database operations.

- **Managed Data Efficiently with AutoMapper and LINQ**:  
  Employed **AutoMapper** and **LINQ** to manage data transformations and queries effectively. AutoMapper automated object-to-object mapping, reducing manual coding efforts, while LINQ provided powerful query capabilities that allowed for flexible and performant data manipulation without sacrificing clarity.

- **Collaborated in a Cross-Functional Team**:  
  Worked closely with a cross-functional team to ensure the smooth integration of frontend and backend components. I optimized API designs to ensure compatibility with the frontend, facilitating seamless communication between the layers, and contributed to the overall success of the project by maintaining clear and effective communication within the team.
